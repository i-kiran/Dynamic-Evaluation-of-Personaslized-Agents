# Research Paper: Dynamic Evaluation of Personalized Agents

## Abstract

The resurgence of interest in agents, fueled by advances in generative AI, underscores the need for effective evaluation frameworks. An effective personalized agent needs to be not only autonomous and capable, but also adaptable to user's evolving needs. This perspective paper highlights the importance of adopting dynamic evaluation methods that can capture the evolving nature of personalization. We propose new perspectives for a comprehensive evaluation framework that models user personas with advancing attributes and preferences that keep evolving. Within this framework, agents engage with simulated users, conducting structured interviews to elicit their preferences and provide tailored recommendations. These recommendations are then dynamically evaluated through Large Language Model (LLM)-driven user simulations, allowing for an adaptive and iterative assessment process. Designed for flexibility, our framework can accommodate a wide range of agents and applications, ensuring a robust and versatile evaluation of recommendation strategies. We present a case study of online shopping scenarios using the PersonalWAB dataset to demonstrate its ability to evaluate personalized agents across different tasks and contexts. <--to add results and highlights-->
