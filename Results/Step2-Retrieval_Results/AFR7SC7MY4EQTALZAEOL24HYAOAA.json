    "title": "Urban Boundaries Toddler Baby Waterproof Winter Snow Ski Mittens",
    "description": "Still can\u2019t decide if you should buy these toddlers infant ski mittens? Below is a recap of why you should buy these mittens for your child as well as additional information not covered in the bullet points: EASY ON / OFF FUNCTIONALITY : These mittens come with a Velcro strap that allows you to expand the opening of the mitten to make it easier to get them on and off. The best part is that your child\u2019s hands are still not exposed to the elements thanks to an expanding polyester bridge that is exposed when you open the Velcro strap. GATHERED ELASTIC SNOW GUARD AT WRIST : The opening of these baby mittens features a gathered elastic band to keep snow and cold weather out, while keeping your child\u2019s hands warm and dry. FIT TRUE TO SIZE : While sized 2T \u2013 4T, if your son or daughter\u2019s hand measures inside 3\u201d wide and 6\u201d long, they\u2019ll fit into these snow mittens. By having a generous internal compartment, it expands the number of sizes that can still wear these snow mittens beyond the 2T \u2013 4T range (both below and above that age group). THINSULATE LINED & WATERPROOF : These mittens come with 40 gram Thinsulate lining \u2013 perfect for most US weather conditions \u2013 and waterproof under normal use conditions. KEEPING TRACK OF YOUR MITTENS MADE EASY : These mittens come with a two part system to allow you to keep track of your toddlers mittens in and out of season. In season, you get a free pair of sturdy/strong mitten clips to attach to each mitten and coat sleeve. Out of season, the exterior of the mittens features a hook / slot function to connect the two mittens so you don\u2019t start following season with only one mitten!",
    "features": "HOW DO THESE BOYS / GIRLS TODDLER / INFANT WINTER MITTENS FIT? These ski mittens fit true to size for ages 2T \u2013 4T, but are not limited to this age group. The interior mitten area measures 6\u201d long x 3\u201d wide (seam to seam). This amount of room transforms the mitten into a snow glove for kids, baby girls and boys, and for older boys whose hands still fit within the 3\u201d w x 6\u201d l area. These waterproof mittens are extra-long measuring 8.5\u201d from tip to opening ensuring they stay tucked in under coats. THINSULATE TEMPERATURE RATING: These toddler mittens come with 40 gram Thinsulate lining and are best for temperatures of 20 degrees Fahrenheit and up, making them the perfect weight for most regions in the United States with exception to those in extreme cold. Baby mittens for girls or boys with 40 gram Thinsulate are thin enough to allow for great flexibility yet aren\u2019t too hot \u2013 heavier weight Thinsulate is extremely warm and can lead to sweaty hands which isn\u2019t ideal in cold weather. ARE THESE KIDS MITTENS WATERPROOF? The quick answer is \u201cyes\u201d, but the more accurate answer is \u201cyes, these winter mittens are waterproof under NORMAL use conditions\u201d. Normal use conditions includes playing in the snow, sledding, going to the store, all standard outdoor activities in the cold and snow. Feel good sending your child outside, and expect your kid\u2019s hands to be warm and dry under these situations. HOW DO YOU WASH / CARE FOR THESE WATEPROOF MITTENS? While hand washing is ideal, it\u2019s not always practical. These baby mittens can go in the wash machine on delicate, and be partially dried on delicate. We recommend NOT drying them fully and allow them to partially air dry. The exterior shell, liner, and filling are 100% polyester, and the Thinsulate is 65% Olefin/35% Polyester, but there is a synthetic waterproof shield between the shell and liner that could be compromised by extreme heat. DO THESE BABY TODDLER MITTENS COME WITH CLIPS? They do not come with the tradtional clips that secure them to your childs jacket. However, they do come with a plastic clip and loop system built into the exterior of the winter mittens. Clip them together out of season so you don\u2019t lose one.",

This radical design departure for sandals spawned the overriding Keen philosophy of hybrid innovation--striving to create new possibilities and to discover and implement original ideas. Keen products put an emphasis on the joys of play. At the same time, Keen believes in the value of working hard to give back to the community. To that end, the company has partnered with non-profit organizations around the world to help get youth into the outdoors, protect land for its environmental and recreational value, and to give bikes to kids in need.
