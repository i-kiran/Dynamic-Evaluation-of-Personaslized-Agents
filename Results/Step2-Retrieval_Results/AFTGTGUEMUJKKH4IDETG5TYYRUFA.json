The updates for this franchise focus on creating a softer and smoother riding design with a more efficient toe-off. This offering also incorporates reflective accents throughout the design, which allow you to stay more visible in low-light conditions. The redesigned mesh upper helps keep feet cool, reduces the shoe's weight, and improves support. Additionally, the external TPU heel counter helps the foot stay more secure while creating a more comfortable foothold. At midstance, the foot should stop pronating and re-supinate for an efficient toe-off. To help this natural motion, we incorporate DYNAMIC DUOMAX\u00ae technology to help support the foot and increase stability for runners whose feet roll inward too much (overpronate). The midsole is also layered with a combination of our FLYTEFOAM\u00ae Propel material and GEL\u00ae technology cushioning to equip runners with a softer landing and an energized bounce. SPACE TRUSSTIC\u2122 technology is placed under the shoe's arch, which provides stability and reduces the overall weight to promote a smoother transition from foot strike to toe-off. Added stability is complemented by deeper forefoot flex grooves that help isolate the initial impact to force a softer feeling at footstrike. Followed by a smoother roll through toe-off, these grooves also allow the shoe to move more naturally with the foot. Lastly, a large section of reflective materials in the rearfoot help keep runners visible when running in low-light conditions. The GEL-KAYANO\u00ae 27 LITE-SHOW\u2122 model is an excellent choice for both competitive and non-competitive runners looking for an everyday trainer that combines comfort with support.",
