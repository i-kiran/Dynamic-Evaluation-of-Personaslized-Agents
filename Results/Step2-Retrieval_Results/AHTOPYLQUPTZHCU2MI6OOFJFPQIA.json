The clear plastic prep bowl locks into place with a simple twist, while the blades can be set sharp side up for chopping onions or grating Parmesan cheese, or turned blunt side up for making walnut pesto or whipping up chocolate frosting. The set includes a spatula and a cleaning brush to remove coffee grounds. For best results, cut ingredients into small, even pieces--about 1/2-inch square or so works well.

Nonstick plates allow you to remove warm pizzelle without breaking them, so they can be rolled for cannolis or cones. Plates wipe clean with a damp cloth, and the unit stands up for compact storage. Amazon.com Crisp, sweet, and decoratively imprinted, pizzelle cookies make a wonderful holiday gift--as does the press itself. To use, simply scoop a spoonful of batter on each round nonstick surface of the press, close and latch the lid, and in only 60 seconds two perfect pizzelle are ready. Roll the warm pizzelle around the included wooden dowel to make cannoli, or shape over an inverted custard cup to make a tiny dessert bowl. Pizzelle harden as they cool, and can be eaten flat like crisp cookies or shaped and filled with chocolate mousse, whipped cream, or fruit. A five-setting switch on the press adjusts the temperature for browning preference, and recipes in the instruction booklet offer variations on flavors. A measuring spoon is included. Red and green lights indicate readiness, and a quick reheat time means three dozen of these four-inch cookies can be cooked in no time.
