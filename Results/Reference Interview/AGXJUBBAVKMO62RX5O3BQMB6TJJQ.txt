User: Great to hear your enthusiasm! Let me address your questions one by one:

1. **Specific Features/Ingredients**: The Purex + Clorox2 detergent is known for its unique formulation that combines the cleaning power of Purex with the stain-fighting capabilities of Clorox2. It often includes brightening agents that help maintain and enhance the brightness of your clothes. Additionally, it contains enzymes that target specific stains, making it more effective compared to standard detergents.

2. **Current Discounts/Promotions**: While I canâ€™t check real-time deals, it's a good idea to check popular retailers like Amazon, Walmart, or Target for ongoing promotions. Sometimes, you can find coupons directly on the manufacturerâ€™s website or through coupon sites, and it's worthwhile to keep an eye out for sales, especially during seasonal promotions.

3. **Performance on Different Fabrics**: Many users report that it works really well on a variety of fabrics, including delicates and activewear. However, since the detergent contains bleach, it's a good practice to do a patch test or follow the care labels of your delicates to avoid any potential discoloration. For activewear, the detergent is effective in removing sweat and odors, making it a suitable choice for workout clothes.

If you're interested, I can help you find a specific retailer with competitive pricing or promotions. Just let me know!
