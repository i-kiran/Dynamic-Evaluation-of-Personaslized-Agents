Assistant: Looking for a high-performance all-in-one desktop PC with a large screen, Core i5 processor, and good graphics. Prefer reputable brands with solid ratings.

User: Great choice! To help you find the perfect all-in-one desktop PC, could you please let me know:

1. What size screen are you considering? (e.g., 24", 27", 32" etc.)
2. Do you have a specific budget range in mind?
3. Are there any additional features you're looking for, such as touchscreen capability, storage capacity (HDD vs. SSD), or specific ports?

Assistant: I'm leaning towards a 27" screen, ideally somewhere between the $800 to $1,200 range. I'd prefer an SSD for faster load times, at least 512GB of storage, and a good selection of ports, like USB-C and HDMI. A decent graphics card is also important for occasional gaming. 

Do you have insights on specific brands that would meet these criteria? And how do the warranty options typically compare among manufacturers?

User: Thank you for providing those details! Here are a few reputable brands that often offer high-performance all-in-one desktop PCs within your specified criteria of a 27" screen, Core i5 processor, SSD storage, and good graphics capabilities:

1. **Dell**: Known for its reliability and service, Dell's Inspiron series has some solid all-in-one models. They usually come with good warranty options (typically one year, upgradeable).

2. **HP**: Their Envy and Pavilion series all-in-one PCs are quite popular and offer good performance, including decent graphics for gaming. HP generally has a one-year warranty as well, with options for extended support.

3. **Lenovo**: The Lenovo IdeaCentre series offers robust performance and is well-regarded for build quality. Their warranty options also typically cover one year, with extensions available.

4. **Acer**: The Acer Aspire series provides competitive pricing and good performance, including gaming graphics capabilities. Their warranty is usually similar to others, often one year for parts and labor.

Now, for the warranty comparisons, most manufacturers offer a standard one-year warranty for parts and labor. However, options for upgrading to extend the warranty or add accident protection plans are typically available for an additional cost. It's best to check the specific model you decide on for the exact warranty terms.
