Assistant: Looking for durable, stackable fridge organizer bins with good ratings. Need to fit various foods and maximize space. Prefer transparent plastic with handles. 

I'm thinking about a budget of around $30 to $50 total since I want to get a few to help with organizing. Ideally, I’d like multiple sizes to fit different types of food—some for small items like snacks or condiments and bigger ones for things like fruits and vegetables. Also, I’d prefer options that have a good grip or can withstand daily use without cracking. 

I’ve heard mixed reviews about some brands when it comes to sturdiness, so if you have insights about durability and whether they can be easily cleaned, that would be helpful. Any thoughts on discounts or where to compare prices would be great, too!
