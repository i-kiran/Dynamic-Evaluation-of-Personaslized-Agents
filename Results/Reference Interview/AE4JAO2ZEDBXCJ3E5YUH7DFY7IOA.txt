Assistant: Can you help me craft a detailed review for these PBT keycaps? I want to highlight their quality and ease of installation, but also address the height discrepancy issue. Looking to balance practical insights with critical observations about compatibility.

User: Sure! To help you craft a detailed review for the PBT keycaps, let's focus on a few key aspects. I'll suggest a structure for your review and include points you might consider mentioning. But first, could you tell me if you have any specific experiences or anecdotes you'd like to include? Also, how would you rate the overall experience with the keycaps—positive, neutral, or negative?

Assistant: I appreciate your willingness to help. I can definitely share my thoughts. I would say the overall quality of the PBT keycaps is quite good; they feel durable and provide a satisfying typing experience. However, the height discrepancy is a notable concern, especially for compatibility with various switches and keyboards.

When discussing the quality, I would emphasize the solid feel and texture of the keycaps. They seem to resist wear and tear better than some of the cheaper alternatives. Installation was relatively straightforward, and I appreciated that they came with a keycap puller, which made the process less cumbersome. 

However, I found that the height difference is significant enough to throw off the overall aesthetic and feel. This can particularly be an issue for those using them on mechanical keyboards where each key's profile and height matter for typing comfort and ergonomics.

As for compatibility, it would be helpful to know if these keycaps are designed for a specific layout or if they are more universal. For example, I’d like to understand if they fit standard Cherry MX switches seamlessly or if there are potential compatibility issues with other switch types. 

What do you think would be a good way to balance these positives and negatives in my review? Should I provide a rating system, or stick to descriptive feedback? 

User: It sounds like you have some solid insights to share!
