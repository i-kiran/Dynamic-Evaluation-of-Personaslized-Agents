Assistant: I'm looking for reliable, multi-device keyboards or similar productivity tools. Interested in well-rated options from reputable brands. Any suggestions?

User: Great! To help me narrow down the options for you, could you please answer a few questions?

1. What is your preferred price range for the keyboard?
2. Do you have any preferred brands in mind?
3. Are there specific features you're looking for, such as backlighting, mechanical keys, or a certain design (compact, ergonomic, etc.)?
4. How urgently do you need this product?

Assistant: I'm looking for a good balance between quality and price, maybe around $50 to $100. I have a fondness for brands like Logitech and Microsoft. As for features, I appreciate a comfortable typing experienceâ€”perhaps an ergonomic design would be beneficial. Wireless connectivity would also be a plus, but not essential. I'm not in a rush, so I can wait for good deals or discounts. 

By the way, are there any ongoing sales or promotions I should be aware of when looking at these brands?

User: Thanks for the detailed information! Based on your preferences, here are a few keyboard recommendations from Logitech and Microsoft that fit within your price range and offer ergonomic designs:

1. **Logitech K850 Wireless Keyboard**: This keyboard features an ergonomic design and cushioned palm rest for comfort during long typing sessions. It also has a long battery life.

2. **Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard**: This option includes a split keyboard layout and a separate numeric keypad, which promotes a more natural hand position while typing.

3. **Logitech K860**: A more premium option, it is designed with a curved layout to improve posture and has a split design that can enhance comfort.

4. **Microsoft Surface Keyboard**: Although not specifically ergonomic, it has a sturdy build and a comfortable typing experience, great for multi-device connectivity.

Now, regarding ongoing sales or promotions:
- Major holidays and events such as Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and back-to-school sales often feature discounts on tech products, including keyboards.
- You can also check websites like Amazon, Best Buy, and Newegg for seasonal deals and bundle offers.
- Signing up for newsletters from these brands might give you access to exclusive discounts.

Would you like me to find specific prices or links for any of these keyboards?

Assistant: I appreciate the information you've provided! I'm particularly interested in the Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard, given its split design and potential comfort benefits. Do you know whether it typically falls within my price range during sales? Also, it would be good to understand how reliable the battery life is, and if there are any significant complaints regarding its performance or compatibility with various devices?

User: The Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard generally retails for around $80 to $100, which means it often falls within your price range, especially during sales or promotions. During major sales events, it can sometimes be found for lower prices, so it's worth keeping an eye out for those opportunities.

### Battery Life
The Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard is powered by two AAA batteries, which can last for a substantial time (up to three years) depending on usage. This long battery life is one of the keyboard's notable features, ensuring you won't have to change batteries frequently.

### Performance and Compatibility
In terms of performance, the Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard is generally well-regarded. However, some users have reported:

- **Bluetooth Connectivity**: While it connects via a USB receiver, those using it with Bluetooth-compatible devices have experienced occasional pairing issues. It is best used with devices that support its dongle.
- **Learning Curve**: Because of the split design, some users may take a bit of time to adjust to the new layout. If you are used to traditional keyboards, this may feel different initially.
- **Key Feel**: Some users find the keys to be less tactile than desired, particularly if they prefer a more mechanical feel.

Overall, many users appreciate the comfort benefits it provides, especially during long typing sessions, and it is known for its durability.
