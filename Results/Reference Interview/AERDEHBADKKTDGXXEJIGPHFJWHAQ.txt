Assistant: As a 25-34-year-old female writer, I often find myself on the lookout for gadgets and tools that help make my home more comfortable and functional, especially in my writing space. I lean towards products that enhance my productivity while being reasonably priced. Recently, I've been considering a WiFi extender, and I've come across the TP-Link models.

I'm kinda intrigued by the TP-Link WiFi extender, but I have some considerations before making a purchase. What's the speed range like? And can it effectively eliminate dead zones? It’s crucial to me that I have a stable connection to support my online research and video calls.

Also, I've heard mixed reviews about the Ethernet port. Some say it’s not very reliable for streaming or gaming. Has anyone experienced any speed drops or connection issues when using that port? It would really help if I could get clarification on that.

Customer service is another big concern for me. If something goes wrong, I want to ensure that I can easily get help. Have people experienced good or poor customer support when reaching out about issues with their TP-Link extenders? 

Lastly, are there any discounts or promotions currently available? I’m sensitive to price, even if it’s just a little, so finding the best deal would make me feel a lot better about the purchase.

I’m looking forward to hearing back!
