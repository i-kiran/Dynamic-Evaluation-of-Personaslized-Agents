1. What is your preferred price range for the adapter?
2. Do you have any specific brands in mind that you trust or have used before?

Assistant: Additionally, I'm curious about the type of safety features you're looking for. Are you focused on overcurrent protection, short circuit protection, or maybe something else? It's important to ensure the adapter is reliable, especially if it's for sensitive electronics. 

Also, do you plan to use the adapter for specific devices, or is it more for general purposes? This could affect the suitability of different models.

1. What specific safety features are most important to you (e.g., overcurrent protection, short circuit protection, overheating protection)?
2. Are you using the adapter for any specific device, or is it intended for general use across multiple electronics?

Assistant: Given your criteria of needing a reliable 15V AC adapter, I'm particularly keen on understanding how crucial the build quality is for you. For example, are you looking for something that feels robust and can withstand daily use, or is the performance more critical than the aesthetic? 

Additionally, have you looked into any specific models or brands already, or are you starting from scratch? It's helpful to know if you're leaning towards any particular designs or features that stand out.

1. How important is the build quality versus performance in your decision-making? Would you prioritize robustness or are you more focused on performance efficiency?
2. Are there any specific models or brands you've already considered, or are you open to all options?

Assistant: Also, have you come across any reviews or feedback that particularly caught your attention? It's often helpful to see what other customers are highlighting in their experiences, especially concerning reliability and safety features.

User: Thank you for your insights! To better tailor my recommendations, could you let me know:

1. Have you noticed any specific positive or negative feedback in reviews regarding reliability or safety features that stood out to you?
2. Are there any particular platforms where you typically read reviews (e.g., Amazon, Best Buy, manufacturer websites)?

Assistant: Additionally, are you looking for the adapter to have any certifications, like UL or CE, which could indicate a level of safety and compliance with industry standards? This might be significant if you're connecting it to high-value electronics or appliances.

User: That's an important consideration! To further refine your search, could you please confirm:
