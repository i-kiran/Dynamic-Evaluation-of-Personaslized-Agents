Assistant: Hey there! I'm craving some tasty, no-shell nuts with a savory twist. Any recommendations for high-quality options with great ratings? Bonus points for unique flavors!

User: That sounds delicious! I can help you find some great no-shell nuts with savory flavors. To narrow down the options, could you please let me know:

1. Do you have any specific brands in mind, or are you looking for any brand?

Once I have this information, I can provide you with some great recommendations!

Assistant: I'm always interested in unique flavor combinations. I love spicy snacks, so if there are any options that have a bit of heat to them, that would be awesome! 

As for price, I’m looking for something in the $10-$30 range—nothing too crazy, but I don’t mind spending a bit for quality. And hey, if there are any discounts or bulk-buy options, I’m totally open to checking those out. 

Finally, I prefer snacks that are not overly salted, and if they're organic, even better!

User: Great! Thanks for sharing your preferences. I’ll start looking for no-shell nuts that are savory, uniquely flavored (especially spicy), fall within the $10-$30 range, and ideally are organic and less salty. 

Here are a couple of questions to finalize my search:

1. How much quantity are you hoping to get? (e.g., small bags, larger bulk options)
2. Do you have a preference for the type of nut (e.g., almonds, cashews, pecans, etc.), or are you open to different varieties? 

This will help me provide you with the best results tailored to your needs!

Assistant: Also, are you looking for these nuts to snack on at work or home? Sometimes that can influence my choices—like if I want something portable or more for enjoying at home while coding. Plus, I’d love to hear if you have any favorite flavor profiles beyond spicy, just in case!
