Assistant: Durable, high-quality protective case for AirPods Pro with carabiner. Prefer well-rated options from reputable brands. Functionality and color variety important.

User: Great! To help you find the right protective case for your AirPods Pro, I have a few quick questions:

1. What is your preferred price range for the case?
2. Are there any specific colors you would like to see or avoid?
3. Is there a particular brand you already like or have in mind? 

These will help narrow down the options for you!

Assistant: Also, could you let me know if you prefer any additional features, like waterproofing or shock resistance? And are you more interested in any specific type of carabiner attachment, or is that optional for your needs? I'm curious about how functional you want the case to be beyond just protection.

User: I appreciate your input! Here are the questions to refine your preferences further:

1. Do you want the case to have any additional features, such as waterproofing or shock resistance?
2. Is there a specific type of carabiner attachment you prefer, or is a standard one sufficient for your needs?

Once I have these details, I’ll be able to provide tailored recommendations!

Assistant: I see my previous response was repetitive. I meant to clarify on my end. I’m actually looking for something that balances durability with a bit of flair—maybe some fun colors or patterns. Waterproofing would be a bonus, but it’s not an absolute must. Shock resistance is a big deal, given my daily activities. I also prefer a high-quality carabiner that can handle some weight, but the style isn’t a dealbreaker.
