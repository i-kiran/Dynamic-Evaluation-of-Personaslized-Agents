Assistant: Seeking reliable, well-reviewed portable storage options for my work files.

User: Great! To help you find the right portable storage option for your work files, I’d like to ask a few questions:

1. **Type of Storage**: Are you looking for a portable hard drive, a USB flash drive, or an SSD?
2. **Storage Capacity**: What storage capacity do you need? (e.g., 128GB, 1TB, etc.)
3. **Budget**: What price range are you considering?
