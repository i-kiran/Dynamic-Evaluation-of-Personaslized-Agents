**Review of EVERIE Sous Vide Setup: Compatibility vs Quality**

I recently purchased the EVERIE sous vide setup, excited to enhance my cooking experience. The quality of the materials is commendable, showcasing a thoughtful design with durable construction that feels robust and reliable. The setup does a fantastic job in maintaining temperature consistency, which is essential for achieving perfect sous vide results.

However, I encountered a compatibility issue when trying to use it with my Wancle cooker. Unfortunately, the dimensions and design of the EVERIE setup do not align well with my Wancle model, leading to some frustration in utilizing both products together. It's worth noting that this incompatibility is specific to the Wancle cooker, and may not affect users with other brands.

Despite this challenge, I genuinely appreciate the quality and performance of the EVERIE sous vide setup. It's a shame that it doesn’t fit my particular cooker, as I was excited about its potential. For anyone not using a Wancle, I would highly recommend giving the EVERIE setup a try if you’re looking for precision and ease of use in sous vide cooking.
