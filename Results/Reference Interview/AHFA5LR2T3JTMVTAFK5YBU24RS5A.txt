Assistant: Hi there! I'm looking for comfortable, well-rated everyday bras that offer great support and smoothing. Any suggestions for quality options that won't break the bank?

User: I'd love to help you find the perfect everyday bras! To start, could you share a bit about your size and any preferred brands you might like? Also, what is your budget range for these bras?

Assistant: I appreciate you asking! I'm generally a size 36C, and I prefer brands that are known for comfort and quality, like Bali, Warner's, or even some of the offerings from retailers like Target or Amazon. I'm thinking somewhere around the $30 to $50 range would be a sweet spot for me, especially since I want something that lasts but also feels great! 

Also, do you know if these brands often have sales or discounts? I love to snag a good deal if I can!

User: Great, thank you for providing that information! Here’s a quick summary of what you're looking for: 

- **Size:** 36C
- **Preferred Brands:** Bali, Warner's, Target, Amazon
- **Budget:** $30 to $50
- **Focus:** Comfort, quality, great support, and smoothing

Now, in regards to sales, many retailers do run promotions on lingerie, especially during holidays and certain sales events throughout the year (like Black Friday or end-of-season sales). Brands like Bali and Warner's often offer seasonal discounts, and retailers like Target and Amazon also have regular sales. 

I’ll find some comfortable and well-rated bras within your criteria. Just one more question: do you have any preferences for specific features, such as wireless, underwire, padding, or specific colors?

Assistant: Oh, that's so helpful to know! I typically prefer underwire for that added support, but I've been curious about trying some wireless options, especially if they're known for comfort. As for padding, I like a light lining to give a little shape but nothing too bulky. I’m open to any colors, but I do have a soft spot for neutral tones like nude, black, or pastels. 

Have you heard if these brands have specific styles that tend to be more popular with women my age? It would be nice to go with something that’s tried and true!

User: Thank you for sharing those preferences! Here’s a quick summary to keep in mind:

- **Underwire Preferred** (but open to wireless)
- **Padding:** Light lining
- **Color Preferences:** Neutral tones (nude, black, pastels)
- **Age:** Looking for styles popular among women your age

1. **Bali** – The **Bali Comfort Revolution Underwire Bra** is known for its soft fabric and flexible support.

4. **Amazon** – The **Playtex 18 Hour Ultimate Lift & Support Bra** would be a great option. It's well-rated for comfort, support, and has light padding.

I'll check on prices and availability for these styles and see if any current sales or discounts are available. Would you like me to find options from online retailers, or do you prefer to check local stores?

Assistant: I'm excited to hear your findings about those styles! I usually shop online for convenience, but if something catches my eye while browsing locally, I'm open to visiting stores too.
