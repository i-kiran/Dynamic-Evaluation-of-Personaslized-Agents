1. **Price Range:** What is your budget for these water shoes?
2. **Usage:** What specific outdoor activities will you be using them for (e.g., kayaking, hiking, beach activities)?

Once I have that information, I can suggest some solid brands and options for you!

Assistant: Alright, let's try this again! 

1. **Price Range:** I’m looking to stay in the $50 to $100 range. I don’t need anything too fancy but want durability.
2. **Usage:** I plan to use them for kayaking and a few beach outings, so good grip is essential.
3. **Size/Style Preferences:** I prefer slip-on styles—easy on, easy off! As for color, I can’t go wrong with black or gray, but I’m not averse to a splash of color.
4. **Brand Preference:** I’ve had good experiences with Keen and Merrell in the past, but I’m open to checking out other brands, too.
