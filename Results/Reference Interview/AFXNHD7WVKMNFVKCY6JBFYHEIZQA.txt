Assistant: I see you're looking for joint health and collagen production supplements. Since I care about quality and also want to find something that's reasonably priced, I'm particularly interested in a few things:

2. **Budget**: I'm looking for something in the medium price range, ideally around $20 to $50 a month, depending on the quality and quantity of servings.
  
3. **Ingredients**: I'd like to avoid any unnecessary fillers. If I can find something that combines collagen with other supportive ingredients like glucosamine or turmeric, that would be great. Also, do you know if there are any vegan options available?
